::: {#hero-heading}

My research interests focus on damage mechanics, continuum mechanics, and rational mechanics. These research directions aim to understand the mechanical behavior of materials under complex loading conditions, establish mathematical models describing material damage evolution processes, and analyze the constitutive relationships and mechanical responses of continua from the perspective of rational mechanics.

Through the integration of theoretical analysis, numerical simulation, and experimental validation.
## Background

- Ph.D. Student (in progress): Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), specializing in damage mechanics, continuum mechanics, and rational mechanics
